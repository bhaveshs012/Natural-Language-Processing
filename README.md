## Text Summarization & Web Scrapping 
This file consists of  a piece of text scrapped from a website and involves basic text data pre-processing techniques such as lemmatization, word and senetnce tokenization , stopword removal, punctuation removal, uper to lower case conversion and digit removal. The pre-processed text data is then used for frequency distribution count of words and then used for text ranking and summarization using TF-IDF and Gensim and the results are compared.

## Text Summarization with N-Grams
Similar approach as above is performed for this text data but N-Gram is sued for the frequency of words calculation and summarization. Here Unigrams, Bigrams and Trigrams are created first and then used for frequency count.

## Word Prediction with N-Grams
Created word tokens of the sentence, found frequency for each of the unigrams and relative frequency for bigrams. Performed word prediction using the relative frequency and probability.

## NER & De-Identification Using SPACY
Used Spacy library to perform Named Entity Recognition on a webscarpped news article.
